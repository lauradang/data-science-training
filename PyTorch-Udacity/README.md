# PyTorch Udacity Course

In order to pursue more advanced deep learning projects, I wanted to learn how to use PyTorch. These notebooks are the highlight notebooks that I created during the course's duration. The course is brought to us by Facebook AI and Udacity, provided [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188) for free. 

Further documentation and notes from my learning can be found in my [Gitbook](https://lauradang.gitbook.io/notes/machine-learning/research-papers/style-transfer).
